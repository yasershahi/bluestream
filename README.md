## Before Rebasing

It's recommended to reset rpm-ostree and pin your current deployment before rebasing. This ensures you can return to your current state if needed:

```bash
# View available deployments
rpm-ostree status

# Pin your current deployment (0 is usually the active deployment)
sudo ostree admin pin 0

# Switch to bootc
sudo bootc switch quay.io/fedora/fedora-silverblue:42

# After switch, reboot the system
systemctl reboot
```

## Rebase to BlueStream

### Rebase Command

```bash
sudo bootc switch ghcr.io/yasershahi/bluestream:latest

# After the rebase, reboot the system
systemctl reboot
```

Note: The image is signed with Cosign for security, and bootc handles the verification automatically.

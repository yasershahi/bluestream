## Before Rebasing

It's recommended to reset rpm-ostree and pin your current deployment before rebasing. This ensures you can return to your current state if needed:

```bash
# View available deployments
rpm-ostree status

# Pin your current deployment (0 is usually the active deployment)
sudo ostree admin pin 0

# Switch to bootc
sudo bootc switch quay.io/fedora/fedora-silverblue:42

# After switch, reboot the system
systemctl reboot
```

## Rebase to BlueStream

### Rebase Command

```bash
# Optional: Verify image signature before switching (recommended)
cosign verify --key cosign.pub ghcr.io/yasershahi/bluestream:42

# Switch to BlueStream
sudo bootc switch ghcr.io/yasershahi/bluestream:42

# After the rebase, reboot the system
systemctl reboot
```

Note: While bootc doesn't handle signature verification automatically, you can manually verify the image's signature using Cosign before switching. The public key (cosign.pub) is provided in this repository.

## Post-install Steps (Optional)

After installing BlueStream, you may want to perform some additional setup for a better experience:

### Docker Setup
Docker is provided in this image, but you need to perform a few steps to enable it for your user:

1. **Create the docker group (if it doesn't exist):**
   ```sh
   sudo groupadd docker
   ```
2. **Add your user to the docker group:**
   ```sh
   sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
   ```
3. **Enable Docker and containerd services:**
   ```sh
   sudo systemctl enable docker.service
   sudo systemctl enable containerd.service
   ```
4. **Apply group changes without rebooting:**
   ```sh
   newgrp docker
   ```
After these steps, you should be able to use Docker as your regular user without sudo.

### Change Default Shell to Fish
Fish shell is included in this image. If you wish to use it as your default shell, follow these steps:

1. **Run fish for the first time:**
   ```sh
   fish
   ```
2. **Locate the installed path:**
   ```sh
   which fish
   # Should output: /usr/sbin/fish
   ```
3. **Add fish to /etc/shells (if not already present):**
   ```sh
   echo /usr/sbin/fish | sudo tee -a /etc/shells
   ```
4. **Change your default shell to fish:**
   ```sh
   chsh -s /usr/sbin/fish
   ```
5. **Reopen your terminal. To disable the Fish welcome message:**
   ```sh
   nano ~/.config/fish/config.fish
   ```
   Add this line to the file:
   ```sh
   set -g fish_greeting ""
   ```
You may need to log out and log back in for the shell change to take effect.

### (Optional) Enhance Your Fish Shell with Starship Prompt

1. **Install a Nerd Font** (required for best Starship experience):
   - Download and install a font like JetBrainsMono from [Nerd Fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/).

2. **Install Starship prompt:**
   ```sh
   curl -sS https://starship.rs/install.sh | sh
   ```

3. **Configure Fish shell to initialize Starship:**
   ```sh
   nano ~/.config/fish/config.fish
   ```
   Add this line to the end of the file:
   ```sh
   starship init fish | source
   ```

4. **(Optional) Use a Starship preset:**
   - See available [Starship presets](https://starship.rs/presets/)
   - Example (Pure preset):
     ```sh
     starship preset pure-preset -o ~/.config/starship.toml
     ```

After these steps, your Fish shell will have a beautiful, fast, and informative prompt!
